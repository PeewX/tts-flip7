## Credits
Our mod started as a fork of the original workshop mod but has since been almost entirely rewritten from scratch. The main reason for this was our goal to introduce numerous new features and quality‑of‑life improvements. However, the original codebase was in such poor condition due to bad structure, inconsistent naming, lack of documentation, and extensive use of AI‑generated code so that a almost full rewrite became the only practical solution.

That said, we want to express our gratitude to the original creators for their foundational work. Especially for creating the initial card decks, game table and player zones. Their efforts provided a solid starting point for our own development.
